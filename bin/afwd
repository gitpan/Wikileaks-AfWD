=head1 QUICK START GUIDE

For this to work, you will need to install SQLite3 and DBD::SQLite

You will also need the SQL file from "http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010".

    sqlite3 -init afg_std.sql afwd.sql
    #if sh/bash
    export AfWD_DBICS="dbi:SQLite:dbname=afwd.sql"
    #if tcsh
    setenv AfWD_DBICS "dbi:SQLite:dbname=afwd.sql"
    #dump them all to AfWD.txt
    afwd > AfWD.txt
    #do the same search with a WHERE of "DColor LIKE 'BLUE'"
    afwd "DColor LIKE 'BLUE'" > blue.txt
